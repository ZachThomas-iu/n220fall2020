    INPUT

    Inputs are HTML tags that put fields onto the page.
    We can access the input values inside a function to get data from a user.
    We will access them by getting a HTMLElementReference to the input.

    <input id="username" />


    GETTING A REFERENCE TO THE INPUT

    Using document.querySelector and the ID of the element

    HTML
    <input id="txtName" />

    JS
    let txtName = document.querySelector("#txtName");
-->

    <!--
        We'll get a small little text box that people can type in.
        
        <input id="txtName" />
    -->

    <!--
        Problem is, that text box won't add anything inside the console.
        This is where we add a button to get a value from the input.
        
        <button onclick="rollDie()">ROLL!</button>

        Note that the button has some javascript in it. 

        We also need to write ".value" in our javascript after the respective tag
        to make sure the code gets that value after it's been written. 
    -->

        <input id="txtName" />

        <!--This creates a line break so not everything is on the same line.-->
        <br />

        <!--The "ROLL!" will be the text inside the button.-->
        <button onclick="rollDie()">ROLL!</button>

    <!--
        The dice roll is neat and all, but we can only see it in the
        console log right now.

        Let's make it show up on the page. 
    -->

        <br />
        <div id="dvResult"></div>
    
    <!--The script tag will always come before the /body tag.-->
    <script src="js/app.js"></script>

</body>
